**Skin&Bones** is a mod that allows import BOBJ (extended OBJ format) animated models that are available through Metamorph, and they can be configured in as similar fashion as [Emoticons](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/emoticons) morphs. 

This mod is **no longer being maintained by McHorse.** If you want to do anything with this project, give me proper credit, and you'll have to support the userbase yourself. There is no way I'm going to support any questions regarding BOBJ format, loading models, and etc. **You're on your own**.
**This project is now maintained by Chryfi. If you also want to contribute to official updates, please join the official [McHorse's Discord server](https://discord.gg/qfxrqUF), so we can communicate with you.**
**This project was edited by [Leclowndu93150](https://github.com/Leclowndu93150/snb) to have the Emoticons Sharp bends functionality inside SNB, forked by me just to upload the final compiled mod file**

**For any questions regarding the sharp bends, please refer to my [forked SnB wiki](https://gist.github.com/IyeViking/ceaabb12b3351ffbb319a5590acb5553).**
